1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

Created by Facebook, ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces via re-usable UI components. It is meant to make data handling scalable, faster, and easier.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

It means approaching building your app or webpage through the use of components and modular, explicit code - just like React was meant for.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Functional is primarily for building a single component that serves a single purpose while Class lets you build multiple components and children of components without having to create a bunch of new functions to serve every individual purpose. Class is for heavier amounts of data. Both can be used in React.

4.  Describe state.

State stores attributes inside the component and allows you to access/modify those attributes through setState by using methods outside the component. It's like the data that you have access to.

5.  Describe props.

Props, short for properties, are the single values or whole object of values that can be passed around to React components within your project. They can be created using JSX and easily accessed with _this.props_.
